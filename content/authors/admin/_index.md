I am currently a Postdoctoral Fellow at the [Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research](https://www.wehi.edu.au/) with joint appointment between the [Colonial Foundation Healthy Ageing Centre](http://colonialfoundation.org.au/) (CFHAC) and the [Bioinformatics Division](https://www.wehi.edu.au/about-structure/scientific-divisions/bioinformatics). At WEHI, I develop novel statistical bioinformatic methods for processing, interpreting, and analyzing large-scale proteomic datasets from the latest time-of-flight mass spec technology. I collaborate with the clinical partners of the CFHAC to facilitate biological discoveries related to ageing and disease.

In 2020, I graduated from the PhD program in [Biostatistics](https://sph.unc.edu/bios/biostatistics/) of the [University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill](https://www.unc.edu/). During my doctoral studies, I have worked on the field of epigenomics developing statistical methods for the analysis of high-throughput sequencing epigenomic assays. I have been collaborating in the [Hispanic Community Health Study / Study of Latinos (HCHS/SOL)](https://sites.cscc.unc.edu/hchs/) by developing and applying statistical methods to analyze data from the HCHS/SOL under complex survey design settings.
